This component is intended to be used for generation of contract phase headers and c implementation templates of core software components.

The RTE generator license used for this is based of the one delivered for a GM project (see SIPLicense.lic in the tools/Sip directory).

The limitation due to this is that all components will get generated with this SIP identifier as part of the comments in the generated files.
