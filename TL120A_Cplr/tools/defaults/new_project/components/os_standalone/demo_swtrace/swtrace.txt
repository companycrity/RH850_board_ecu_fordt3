NOTE: This demo requires a hardware connection to an RH850 board via
      850eserv2.

This demo uses the software trace features of the RH850 hardware to log
function entries and exits and to log user-specified values during program
execution.  Messages for the logged events are displayed in the trace list
window.

The demo shows the behavior of the various log functions, and discusses some
of the uses of this functionality.  For more documentation of the features,
refer to the manual "MULTI: Building Applications for Embedded V850 and RH850"
or the header file "include/v800/rh850_eagle.h".
