/*
  Thread-Local Library Data Retrieval
  ===================================

  ThreadLocalStorage is a structure that contains all static library data
  that the Green Hills libraries allow to be allocated per-thread. To
  configure the libraries to allow the maximum amount of thread safety,
  the contents of this structure must be allocated for each thread
  and __ghs_GetThreadLocalStorageItem must return the specified
  thread-specific library data when called.

  An implementation can choose which of these data structures to allocate
  for each thread. For example, an implementation may choose to
  allocate an errno value for each thread, but not the strtok_saved_pos
  pointer. The application could then use strtok_r instead of strtok for
  thread-safety.

  If C++ with exceptions is being used, the __eh_globals entry must be
  allocated for each thread.

  If __ghs_GetThreadLocalStorageItem is customized to
  return a per-thread errno value, define the preprocessor symbol
  USE_THREAD_LOCAL_ERRNO in ind_errn.c.

  If __ghs_GetThreadLocalStorageItem is customized to
  return a per-thread SignalHandlers array, define the preprocessor symbol
  USE_THREAD_LOCAL_SIGNAL in ind_sgnl.c.
