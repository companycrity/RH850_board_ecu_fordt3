 * MULTI you must already be debugging the corresponding ELF file. You will
 * also need to connect to your target or to a simulator for the traced CPU.
 * NOTE2: Trace files created by this function also do not include information
 * about the state of tasks and AddressSpaces on the target. Therefore this
 * function is not capable of creating trace files for INTEGRITY systems with
 * virtual AddressSpaces and it cannot create trace files which include
