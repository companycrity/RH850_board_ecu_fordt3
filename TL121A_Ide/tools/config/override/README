This directory can be used to override ghs.cfg for any Green Hills
application.  By creating a file named application_name.cfg in this
directory, you can override the default configuration for the application
(application_name refers to the name of the particular application).

For more information, see the section of the MULTI: Editing Files and
Configuring the IDE manual on application-specific configuration override
files.
