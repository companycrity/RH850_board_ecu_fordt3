<h3>INTEGRITY Virtual AddressSpace</h3>
<hr SIZE="1" NOSHADE>
<p>
The result of building a virtual AddressSpace project is a fully linked ELF
executable, called a virtual AddressSpace program. This program contains
only the code and data for this single virtual AddressSpace. 
</p>
<p>
User code for a virtual AddressSpace program begins with the standard C/C++
function main(). The entrypoint of the program is actually _start,
which initializes the virtual AddressSpace so that the C/C++ run-time
environment and the INTEGRITY API can be used. _start transfers control to
main(), the start of user code for each virtual AddressSpace.
</p>
<p>
The thread of control executing into main() is known as the Initial Task.
The name of the Initial Task as seen in the MULTI Task window is Initial,
grouped with any other tasks that may be in the same AddressSpace.
