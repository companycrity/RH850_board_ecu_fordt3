<h3>INTEGRITY Monolith</h3>

<p>
A monolith image is a stand-alone executable, suitable for running directly
on a target, that contains a kernel and virtual AddressSpaces. Use a Monolith
INTEGRITY Application Project to take advantage of the safety and security
of INTEGRITY's memory mapping for application code without requiring
run-time download.
