<h3>INTEGRITY Standalone Kernel</h3>
<hr SIZE="1" NOSHADE>
<p>
A kernel is a stand-alone executable linked with INTEGRITY libraries
suitable for running directly on a target. Use a KernelSpace project
when only physical space is needed, or when further virtual AddressSpaces
may be downloaded at run time.
