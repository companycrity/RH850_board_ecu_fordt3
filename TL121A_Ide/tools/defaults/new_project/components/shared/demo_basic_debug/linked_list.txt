DESCRIPTION:

    Basic Debugging Example Program

        This simple example will add names and information to a linked
    list and then print the contents of the linked list to standard out.
    Its purpose is to demonstrate debugging in the MULTI Integrated
    Development Environment.
       This file is accompanied by a script file, basic_debug.rc.  This 
    script will set breakpoints and display messages in the debugger’s 
    command pane.  To run the demo, follow the directions printed in the 
    command pane.
                                                                                                         
DEMO SCRIPT:

1. Build Project, Connect to a Remote Target, and Open Debugger.

    Build the project by selecting "Build->Rebuild All".

    Connect to a remote target by clicking the Connect button in the Builder.

    Open the Debugger on the Current Project.  This can be done by selecting 
    the menu option "Debug->Debug Current Project..." or Click on the "Debug" 
    icon in the tool bar.

2. Running the Application

    When the debugger is opened it will automatically load the "basic_debug.rc" 
    script file.  The script file will guide you through the program,
    highlighting some features of the MULTI debugger.
