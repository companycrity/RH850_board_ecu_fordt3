DESCRIPTION:

    Testing software is one of the more important aspects of software
    development.  How well is your application tested?  How much code
    was never even executed during your testing cycle?  It is very 
    difficult to answer these questions, even if you are extremely 
    familiar with the application code.

    Code Coverage analysis allows you to see which lines of code were (and
    were not) executed during a run or number of runs of your program.

    The MULTI debugger's code coverage analysis tools include reports which
    show coverage percentages for functions and can also conveniently 
    highlight code which was not executed in the source pane of the debugger. 

DEMO SCRIPT:

1. Build Project, Connect to a Remote Target, and open it in the Debugger.

    Build the project by clicking the Build button in the MULTI Project
    Manager.

    Connect to a remote target by clicking the Connect button.

    Open the Debugger on the Current Project by clicking the Debug button.

2. Running the Application

    In order to enable profiling on a project pre-configured to generate 
    coverage analysis code select the menu option "View->Profile...".
    You should open profiling before running or stepping your program.

    Debug your code as normal, allowing the application to terminate.  When 
    execution terminates select the "Profile" window.  Notice that
    Code Coverage information was found.

    Select the "Coverage View" icon from the tool bar of the "Profile" window.
    You may now run coverage reports from the "Profile" window.  Also note,
    when "Coverage View" is selected the lines of code which where not 
    executed will appear highlighted in the main debugger source window.

    Refer to the MULTI documentation for more information on profiling.
