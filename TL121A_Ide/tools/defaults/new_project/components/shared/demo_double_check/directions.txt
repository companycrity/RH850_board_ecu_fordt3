DESCRIPTION:

    The twelve examples in this demonstration are all from actual production
    quality code.  This code was assumed to work, tested, and in most cases
    released to customers.  DoubleCheck was able to identify problems in the
    code that normal testing often misses.  DoubleCheck found problems in
    seconds that were not found in months of expensive testing.  Several of
    these bugs were causing customers problems but the issues could never be
    reproduced or identified by the authors of the code until DoubleCheck was
    employed. 

    The examples have been cut down from their original size to make them
    easier to understand.  Some of them originally spanned hundreds of
    lines or involved code located in different functions and files.
    DoubleCheck does a good job at finding bugs involving interactions
    between large pieces of code; an area where human software developers
    often suffer.

    The code examples demonstrate why DoubleCheck is a powerful source
    analysis tool crucial for anyone involved in the software design and
    development field.  Unlike other source analysis tools that require
    an additional slow secondary pass to find bugs, DoubleCheck runs at the
    same time as the compiler generally not noticeably increasing compilation
    times.  This tight integration with the compiler makes it simple to use,
    just add the -double_check.level= option to a project.

DEMO SCRIPT:

1. Build project by pressing F7.

    You'll immediately see DoubleCheck error and warnings messages appear.
    These can be selected in the "Build Details" window and the related code
    will be highlighted in the editor.  For a more informative view of the
    identified bugs continue to #2 below.

2. View the DoubleCheck report.

    In the "MULTI Project Builder" right-click on demo.cc and select
    "View DoubleCheck Report" from the menu that appears.  A web browser
    should appear displaying a report of the errors found while building.
    Click on each error to see where in the code the problem exists and read
    the comment above each example function to understand more about the bug.
