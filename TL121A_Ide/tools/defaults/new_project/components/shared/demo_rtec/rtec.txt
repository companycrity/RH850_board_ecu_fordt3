DESCRIPTION:

    Simple programming errors that cannot be detected at compile-time can
    be very difficult to debug.  Errors such as indexing outside of an 
    array boundary can overwrite other variables giving erroneous values 
    later in your application.

    MULTI's run-time error checking will halt execution, warning that a 
    run-time error has occurred during your debug session.  

    If it is undesirable for your application to halt at a run-time error,
    see the "Custom Run-Time Error Checking" example.

DEMO SCRIPT:

1. Build Project, Connect to a Remote Target, and Open Debugger.

    Build the project by selecting "Build->Rebuild All".

    Connect to a remote target by clicking the Connect button in the Builder.

    Open the Debugger on the Current Project.  This can be done by selecting 
    the menu option "Debug->Debug Current Project..." or Click on the "Debug" 
    icon in the tool bar.

2. Running the Application

   Start the application by pressing the "F5" key.  The debugger will 
   halt when it detects a run-time error.

   If you are using an architecture which traps any of these errors, you 
   can comment out lines of code generating the trapped calls to see
   the rest of the demo.

   Some targets will generate a hardware exception when dividing by zero.  If 
   you choose to continue after hitting this run-time error the behavior of 
   the target may be unpredictable and keep the target application from 
   completing the example.

   See the MULTI documentation for more information on run-time error
   checking.
